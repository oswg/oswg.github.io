          <p>We give this instrument a vision it does not understand. This instrument sees the hammer descending upon
            the anvil and the rock breaking. We attempt to say to this instrument that that which is not tempered will
            break. Go through the fire of experience willingly, my friends, and be tempered a bit at a time, that with
            experience you may bend and learn and become stronger, and serve more and more that great ideal that you so
            cherish. On the surface the spiritual path seems poetic and dramatic and will attract many who will become
            weak-hearted. Know, my friends, the spiritual path is for those who are tough and wish to become tougher.
            Perfect compassion involves an unbelievable personal discipline, for how in this great illusion can you
            naturally believe that all others are one with you?</p>

          What service to others is all about is taking that same group which, indeed, needs to be of service to
          itself, and encouraging its own members in their services to others, and turning each person outwards so
            that when the hands are again held and the energy [again] is moving from the left to right hand, the energy
            then moves clockwise, the service-to-others direction<a
              href="https://www.llresearch.org/transcripts/issues/1988/1988_0629.aspx#_ftn1">[1]</a>. Realize that
            whatever your service is to be, it has to do with facing outwards and offering without any expectation what
            it is you feel you can do and may do to be of spiritual service to another. Never stop holding hands with
            those companions you have been blessed with along the way, and gazing into each others’ eyes and enjoying
            the sharing of the group energy that feeds you, but always remember that those who truly wish to serve shall
            be turning vulnerably outward and offering the gift of self, with the Creator shining through, that light
            may be seen in a dark world.</p>
