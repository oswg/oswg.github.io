  The Other Selves Working Group is a non-hierarchical union of spiritual seekers 
  who have come together as equals for the purpose of living our lives as a study 
  of the Law of One. We strive to maintain a focus on living according to the 
  philosophy promulgated by the Confederation of Planets in Service to the Infinite 
  Creator. This involves helping each other balance in our lives and offering service 
  in our daily lives in such ways as befit our abilities. As dedicated seekers who 
  engage in personal spiritual work as a condition of participation in the working 
  group, we also attempt to lighten the planetary vibration through all loving means 
  available to us.
